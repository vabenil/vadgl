### Warning
This library is still in alpha states and will be actively changing. If you have
any change in mind put it as an issue here.

### About
D abstraction over OpenGL. Planned to be used with any OpenGL bindings.

### Why
OpenGL is not known for having the best error handling. This library provides a
more D-like interface for OpenGL with it's own error handling model for better
debugging. Additionally Type safe wrappers of OpenGL functions are implemented
where sensible

### TODO:
- Add more version blocks **[important]**
- Maybe add runtime checks
- Write documentation
- Add more OpenGL functions
